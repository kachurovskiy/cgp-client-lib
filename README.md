# What CGP Client Library is for

CGPClient Library is a tiny ActionScript 3.0 library that lets you create  simple **CommuniGate Pro** Flash/Flex/AIR client in 5 minutes. 

Pass login credentials, and a few moments later you can work with server  over simple XML-based XIMSS protocol that allows to read/send mail, IM and much more. For example sending IM looks in code like 

    Net.ximss(<sendIM peer="friend@server.com">Hi there!</sendIM>, null, responseCallBack);
